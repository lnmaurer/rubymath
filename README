rubymath -- a web interface for ruby with a focus on doing math. The goal is to
have a web interface like SAGE (http://www.sagemath.org/), but be written in
ruby. It uses the symbolic library to do symbolic mathematics, and currently 
supports syntax highlighting and basic 2D plotting.

It is in a rough but working state, and can use any help that it can get.

This program relies on require haml, sinatra, and coderay -- available as ruby
gems.

It also requires a recent version of symbolic:

The mathserver.rb file should be edited to reflect the location of this library.

To start the program, run mathserver.rb with ruby ("ruby mathserver.rb" on the
command line) and then open http://localhost:4567 with a web browser. The
server may take some seconds to start, so if nothing shows up at that address,
hit refresh until it does.

Enter any ruby commands in the input and you're good to go.
